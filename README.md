# Assignment 1: OOP Java Library System

**Student Name:** Ghulam Ali Shafei 
**Class:** IT-2509

## About this Project
This is my first Java assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course. It includes three main parts:

1. **Rectangle Class:** A tool that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. It has built-in rules to make sure width and height are always positive.
2. **Book Class:** A system to store book details like Title, Author, and Year. It also tracks if a book is currently in the library or borrowed.
3. **Library Application:** A program that lets a user add books, search for them, borrow/return them, or delete them using a simple menu.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in an IDE (like IntelliJ or VS Code).
2. Find the file named `main.java`.
3. Run that file to see the menu in the console.
